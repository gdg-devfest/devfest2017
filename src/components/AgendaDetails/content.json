In this talk we’ll trace through the steps to see how Android decides which view should handle a touch, and how the system differentiates between swipes and clicks. We’ll start by visually examining how a view hierarchy is laid out and examine the multiple methods involved when the system receives a touch. Then we’ll look into the different kinds of gestures that are categorized in Android and how the system finally decides to call the ubiquitous onClickListener(). Lastly, we’ll work through a detailed real-world example of touch handling with RecyclerViews."

And estimates put internet usage with a screen reader as high as 3.4% of all internet traffic around the world. Web accessibility can help. So what is web accessibility and who needs it? Is engineering accessibility enough? How do you build an cross-functional accessibility culture? And what can you do to prevent regressions? I had all the same questions… and only four months to guarantee all our consumer user flows were accessible. Well, what happened? Come learn what it takes to lead a web accessibility movement within your company!"

Recognizing antonymy is a key task for improving the performance of NLP systems like Machine Translation and even for chat bots to understand opposing statements and sarcastic comments. This novel neural network model, AntNET, outperforms state-of-the-art models in distinguishing antonyms from other semantic relations and is capable of efficiently handling multi-word expressions.
